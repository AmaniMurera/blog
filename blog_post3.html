								<h1>Interesting tools/technologies I encountered in preparation for Programming Bootcamp<br></h1>
								<p class="lead">
									
									<p> Everyone who starts a journey of becoming a software developer no matter which programming language he is learning he must face many technology tools along the way. And the only way to build an amazing and innovative project which can solve a real-world problem and satisfy customer’s needs is to have technical skills in dealing and using the available technology tools.
                                        Technology tool plays a great role in our daily life because they are designed and implemented in such a way that they simply and accelerate project development and management.
                                        During the preparation of Andela Kigali cycle-12 Bootcamp, I have encountered tons of modern technology tools.
                                        Today I am very interested and excited to share with you the important tools I have encountered and explain to you how these technology tools have performed a huge and important role to me during preparation and this allows me to be ready and comfortable to attend Andela Kigali cycle-12 Bootcamp.</p><br>
										<p>For instance, I have encountered many tools and explaining all of them here on the medium can be a big story that may take even many hours to ready. That is why I am going to be concise and take time to select the most popular tools so that I can dive in, explore and explain them in full details.
											I can not wait to share you a story about these interesting technology tools I have encountered during the preparation of Andela Kigali-cycle12 Bootcamp
											These tools were interesting, useful, important, essential and urgent to me because these tools assisted me in the process of developing, running and testing the Andela Bootcamp project.</p><br>
											<p>The section below explains the most essential, amazing and interesting tools I encountered during the preparation of Andela Kigali cycle-12 Bootcamp.</p>
											<h1>Codepen</h1>
											<p>Codepen is a free online available code editor that simply web application development because it has many functional features to provide all software developers across the globe a convenient environment to develop and run their applications.
												Codepen boosted my development by allowing me to write, debug and execute source codes without installing IDE (Integrated Development Environment) in my computer.
												Codepen has pushed my programming skills to another level because I discovered mored in front-end development.</p>
												<h1>Browser Dev-Tools</h1>
												<p>When I started learning javascript, I did not know that dev-tools are available in my browser and debugging was very difficult for me.
													Honestly fixing one error could take me much time and more energy.
													I was a layman and doing a project was a big challenge because I did not know how to deal with and handle the programming errors using browser Dev-Tools.</p>
													<h1>GitHub</h1>
													<p>Thanks to Linus Torvalds who did a great job to invent Git which is a version control system and GitHub is a famous platform that hosts a Git repository. GitHub made development very faster because it allows us to share our source code with the whole world.
														Git and Github allow developers from different locations to work on one project without affecting their performance. I wonder how developers collaborated before the existence of Git.
														Now I feel safe when my source code are pushed on GitHub and I can not worry even when my computer crashed or stolen Github will rescue me and acts as my back up as it stores all my source code in a safe place where no one can modify or delete them.</p>
														<p>During the preparation of Andela Bootcamp, I have encountered technology tools that will guide me in my career journey and allow me to achieve my desired goals.</p>
