								<h1>My Reflections on the Andela EPIC Values.<br></h1>
								<p class="lead">
									
									<p>Core principle values of Andela can be summarized as EPIC which is an acronym for excellence, passion, integrity, and collaboration. No one born with these aspects requires someone's intention and take initiative to practice EPIC in his daily life. These values are essential and not needed by Andelans only, epic values are emergencies and are needed by everyone to move rapidly and achieve great achievement in his career. Epic values are the solid fundamental and the building block to the development of the Andela company. I was surprised to hear that the building of Andela in Lagos Nigeria is called EPIC tower and I am curious to see that building face to face. This is the second day of Andela Kigali cycle-12 Bootcamp and I am very excited to share with you my reflection on Andela EPIC values and how these values have changed and shaped my life positively. </p><br>
                                    <p>EPIC is an acronym that stands for Excellence, passion, integrity, and collaboration. Great, I hope now you know EPIC in full words but that is not sufficient to understand the meaning, essence, and impact of EPIC values to your life EPIC is an acronym which stand for Excellence, passion, integrity and collaboration its great that now you know EPIC in full words but that is not sufficient to grasp the meaning, essence, and impact of EPIC values to your life but don’t worry because I am going to dive in deep and try to explain Andela EPIC values in more details one by one so that you can be comfortable and be aware of the concepts and the logic behind Andela epic values.</p><br>
                                    <h1>E: Excellence</h1><br>
                                    <p>Excellence is an important attribute. anyone who wishes to perform and accomplish great and amazing things in his career must consider and strive for courage and excellence. with quality of excellence, everything is possible and someone can reach very far in his career. After grasping the significance effect and importance of excellence in my life, I endure a culture of working hard with high performance.
                                        I am always curious to learn and discover more in my career by collecting facts, analyze and understanding concepts before doing software practice and experiment.
                                        Technology is vast and there are tons of concepts and skills to learn. The reason why I decided to apply to Andela is to improve my technical, communication and soft skills in order to acquire in-demand skills needed to become a world-class software developer who can solve social problems in society and work for any of the top companies in the world.</p><br>
                                        <h1>P: Passion</h1>
                                        <p>In this approach of life, everyone has the responsibilities to find his passion and I am lucky because I know my passion, there is nothing which makes me happy than seeing my source codes running successful, even when I get syntax, logic or runtime errors I am very excited to fix the error because I can learn much while I am debugging.</p><br>
                                        <h1>I: Integrity</h1>
                                        <p>This is another important Andela’s core value.
                                            being honest and always saying the truth is the key to build a good relationship and live with others in peace and harmony. At Andela plagiarism and copy someone else’s codes are prohibited.</p><br>
                                            <h1>C: Collaboration</h1>
                                            <p><q>coming together is a beginning, staying together is progress and working together is a success -Henry Ford.</q></p>
                                            <p>anyone who attains and applies EPIC values in his life can explore his full potential to set and achieve his goals.</p>
