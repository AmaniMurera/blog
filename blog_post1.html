								<h1>How I Demonstrated Growth Mindset Recently<br></h1>
								<p class="lead">
									
									<p>For every action I attempt to do in my life, I try to think and act wisely by judging myself and examine the impact of that action on me and even to the surrounding society, to make sure that I have a contribution to the development of the world. 
									Having a growth body or being very old does not mean a growth mindset Because a growth mindset does not symbolized by a big size. Mindset is Measured by observing intention, behavior, creativity, problem-solving Capabilities, critical thinking, collaboration and communication skills of a given person.</p>
									<br>
									<p>Many people didn’t know that mindset is something they can control, Manage, change, grow and develop. but they are wrong because growth Growth mindset is not something a person can buy or inherit from his parents. The mind can always grow and everyone needs to struggle on growing his Mindset to bring his technical and soft skills from one level to another.
									All successful people have a culture of growing their minds constantly because grow mindset is the key to make good decisions, deal with and overcome circumstances and obstacles that prevent them to achieve their desired goals and ambitions. </p>
									<br>
									<p>As far as am concerned, I recently demonstrated the growth of my mindset by Considering life challenges as my opportunity. Challenges have become a part of life, regardless of any tribes, look or believe life will certainly throw tons of Challenges to you and some challenges are inevitable so I do not avoid Challenges or fear to fail. Facing my challenges, deal with them until coming Out of Them stronger than before is what causes me to be victorious. for instance, each time I try something new I experience challenges but I never Give up no matter how challenges are tough, I remain in the cycle of redo, reflect, learn, take risks, try new ways, place effort and learn from mistakes. and this gives me experience and make me stronger than before</p>
									<br>
									<p>In addition, I recently attend meetings, workshops, and conferences. I attended leadership training workshops and presentations, where I learned how I should behave in society by controlling my behavior and emotion. for instance, on 10th- 15th October in 2019 I attended the training in Rwanda Information Society Authority and I have acquired skills and knowledge to protect the system from cyber attack.</p>
									<p>Moreover, I demonstrated a growth mindset by managing my time and setting priorities. When I wake up in the morning I take a short time to make a schedule of the day by making a list of all activities I wish to accomplish and assign priority on each task based on complexity and delivery time. This allows me to be more productive</p>
									<p>In essence, a growth mindset is a magic thing that leads the people to great achievements. Anyone who wants to succeed in life must train his mind to grow and think fast because growth mindset and success are twins and mind can not grow by accident it requires someone put in more efforts and spend enough time develop his mindset by hard work, reading books, building relationship, accept advice, learn from mistakes, control his emotion and believe in himself.</p>
